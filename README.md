### 💡 What I Do

- 🔋 Build **MPPT-based solar circuits** that actually *work*, unlike my diet plan.
- 🎛️ Design sleek PCBs on **KiCad** with **zero flying wires** (okay, almost).
- 💻 Create web apps with React + Firebase that don’t crash… most of the time.
- 🌱 Lowkey farmer: built an **auto plant watering system**. Plants are now thriving. My social life? Not so much.
- 🧪 Experiment with **saltwater batteries**. Spoiler: they fizz, not charge.
- 📦 Automate stuff with **Google Apps Script**. Because who has time for manual work?
- 🎨 Design graphics and videos for fun. I mean, who doesn’t love a good meme?
- 📚 Write LaTeX reports that are more aesthetic than my life choices. (IYKYK👀)
- 🧑‍💻 Build **custom React apps** for event certificate generation. Because why not?
- 🛠️ Fix family tech issues like a pro. (I’m basically the Electrician guy of my house.)
- ☕ Sips tea, and thought about future, while keeping the soldering iron turned on. (IYKYK👀)
- 👨‍🔧 Serve as **family tech support**:  
  “Maa ar phone ar IMEI ura gacha” → fixed  
  “Baba ar laptop slow cholcha” → formatted  
  “Bahi ar online class cholcha naa” → new OS installed 💀

  IR sensor + DC pump during peak COVID = Street Cred 💯

- 🧲 **Mini IR Remote Controlled Car**  
  Does it go fast? No. But it *goes*. (Trust me! It does)

- 🕹️ **Joystick-controlled RGB LEDs**  
  Because pressing buttons is so last year.

- 📦 **Custom React Certificate Generator**  
  Firebase-auth + Apps Script magic for event certificate automation.

- 💳 **UPI Credit Card Bill Payment System**  
  A system to pay credit card bill via UPI payments.
  (Because who needs banks?)

🙅‍♂️ Where Not to Find Me

-   ❌ Facebook / Instagram: Nah fam, I skipped the lockdown-kid starter pack.
I prefer fixing circuits over flexing selfies.
-   ❌ Snapchat? I don’t need a filter to look like a potato.
I’m already a potato in real life.

-   ❌ LinkedIn? Tried it once. Too many “✨open to work✨” posts and not enough real work.
Also, I don’t have enough fake achievements to pretend I’m a “motivated synergy-driven team player.”

-   ✅ Real Life / GitHub / Chai Stall: That’s where the action happens 😎

---

### 🤝 Let’s Collaborate!

- Have an idea that uses sensors, Firebase, or sarcasm?
- Want a buddy to fix your code *and* your aunt’s printer?
- Or just wanna chill with a fellow geek?

**Ping me. I bring multimeters and memes.**
